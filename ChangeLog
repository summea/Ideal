  * VERSION: Bumped version to 0.1.4.

  * model.php: Added query() for general SQL queries.
  Usage: $this->query($query, $values, $multi_level_array_results)
  $multi_level_array_results is true by default; if only a single row
  should be returned from the query(), set $multi_level_array_results
  to false.

  * model.php: Added a-z/z-a support for 'desc' option in find().
  Usage: $this->find('all', array('desc' => 'z-a'))
  Note: if 'desc' option is not set, default is ASC order.

  * VERSION: Bumped version to 0.1.3.

  * model.php: Added saveRelated().  This method breaks down $_POST data
  according to the table, column name, and id (set from a given view.)

  * model.php: Added `keep = array()` option in $options array for find().
  This acts as a way to limit what related tables are actually called when
  tables are related to a particular model.  When array() is assigned,
  (but just left empty,) no tables are attached to the find() results.
  # Usage:
  # 'keep' => array('comments','crankies')  # keep comments and crankies
  # 'keep' => array('comments')             # keep comments
  # 'keep' => array('crankies')             # keep crankies
  # 'keep' => array()                       # keep nothing (except main results)

  * VERSION: Bumped version to 0.1.2.

  * model.php: Added PDO try/catch for errors (to try to somewhat protect
  sensitive data.)

  * model.php: Added ability to use more complex conditions in find():
  # simple JOIN example
  # ...
  'table' => array('comments', 'entries'),
  'fields' => '*',
  'conditions' => array('comments.entry_id = entries.id and',
    array('entries.id' => digits($id)))

  * model.php: Added 'all' selector to find().

  * model.php: Added public $related member variable for models.  Usage:
  public $related = array(
    'has_many' => array(
      'comments' => 'entry_id',
      'crankies' => 'entry_id'
    )
  );

  * model.php: Added findRelated().  Now can find (has_many) related tables that
  are set in models.  Output looks like this:
  Array
  (
      [comments] => Array
          (
              [0] => Array
                  (
                      [id] => 1
                      [0] => 1
                      [subject] => first comment
                      [1] => first comment
                      [body] => comment body
                      [2] => comment body
                      [entry_id] => 1
                      [3] => 1
                  )
          )
  )
